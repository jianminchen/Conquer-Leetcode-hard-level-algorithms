**Hard level algorithms**<br>

It is easy to come out ideas to work on hard level algorithms. But it is hard to get most out of the practice.

It is time for me to be ambitious. I have 3 simple drills to conquer the hard level algorithms. Here is the detail. 

I did a small research about 10 times more efficient programmer, and then I wrote [this blog](http://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/2018/06/10-times-more-efficient-programmer.html) related to be normal, use three simple drills to help myself. 


Here are the blogs I wrote to study tennis coaching and sports coaching:

I did some study on sports training, and also I like to apply to my own training of algorithm and data structure. I apply those advice to my daily practice, contest, mock interview, onsite, and also current work.

Plan to read [the book](https://www.amazon.ca/Talent-Overrated-Separates-World-Class-Performers/dp/1591842948), talent is overrated.

I practiced 8 hard level algorithms in the Canada day long weekend, 2018. [Here](http://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/2018/07/hard-level-algorithms-my-canada-day.html) is one of blogs:

I made the change and started to work Leetcode easy level algorithms instead. My goal is to complete all 190 easy level algorithms left. Also I like to build a good habit to code everyday. I like to start from easy level algorithms, and then get experience how to solve problems.
The blog is called [what is the best way to learn algorithms?](http://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/2018/07/what-is-best-way-to-learn-algorithm.html).

Compared to a hard level algorithm, it is better for me to work on something simple and small. I like to build a good habit to code every day.
